Scattering theory for few-photon transport through Bose-Hubbard lattices.

Library capable for calculation first and second order coherence function for Bose-Hubbard lattices coupled to chiral channels. On current equipment practically with up to 120-150 sites.

Documentation is main in the examples and in the code.
