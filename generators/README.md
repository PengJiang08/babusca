# babusca generators

The generators in this subfolder makes it easy to generate some simple scattering setups consisting of a Bose-Hubbard latttice coupled to one or more chiral channels.

The different generators are,

## Chain

Generates a chain locally coupled to two chiral channels and with any number of additional decay channels.

## Ring 

Generates a ring locally coupled to two chiral channels and with any number of additional decay channels.

## Plane 

Generates a plane which is locally coupled to two chiral channels. The generator can also add a magnetic field penetrating the plane in order to simulate setups supporting Quantum Hall like states.

## Cube

Generates a cube locally coupled to two chiral channels and with any number of additional decay channels.

## Proximate

Generates a chain which couples **quasi-locally** to two chiral channels, and then any number of additional locally coupled decay channels.
