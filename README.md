# babusca

Scattering theory for few-photon transport through Bose-Hubbard lattices.

Library capable for calculation first and second order coherence function for Bose-Hubbard lattices coupled to chiral channels. On current equipment babusca can practically cope with system of up to 120-150 sites.

The code is well documented, and several examples of simple systems are provided in the examples folder.

## Building the scatterer

The Bose-Hubbard scatterer is specificed using the scattering library.

Say, we want to construct a two-site model with onsite energies at ``E1 = +1`` and -1. The two sites are coupled by a coupling t = 2.5

<code>
scattering.Model(Es=[1,-1], links=[(0, 1, 2.5)], Us =
